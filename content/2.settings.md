###### 💻 Launching Your Application 

In the development environment, since it's a Laravel application, follow the common processes for initializing an application. If you haven't seen the [Getting Started](getting-started) section, you can also check the official [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).

Access your application at `http://localhost:8000`

###### 🔍 Post-Build: Exploring Warriorfolio 2 

Now that your application is running, let's dive into customization and advanced features.

###### 🎨 Customizing Theme Colors 

Warriorfolio 2 uses Tailwind CSS via Vite. Modify theme colors in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
theme: {
    extend: {
        colors: {
            primary: colors.purple,
            secondary: colors.zinc,
            tertiary: colors.rose,
        }
    },
},
```

| Class     | Name   | Color |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| Primary   | Purple | 💜     |
| Secondary | Zinc   | 🤍     |
| Tertiary  | Rose   | 🩷     |

###### 📝 Module Header

Unlike previous versions, Warriorfolio 2 allows direct text editing through the Control Panel. Navigate to **App Sections** to modify module heading text.

###### ✨ Customizing Text Highlights

Personalize text highlights in `resources/css/app.css`:

```css
 /** Highlighted text **/
    .text-highlight,
    .heading-module-title strong,
    .tl {
        @apply bg-gradient-to-r from-primary-600 to-tertiary-400 bg-clip-text pr-1 text-transparent;
    }
```

###### 🖼️ Image Slideshow Creation

1. Navigate to **Slideshow** in the control panel
2. Upload desired images
3. Select display module

Note: Landing Page supports only the most recently created slideshow.

###### 📩 Newsletter Module 

The **Newsletter Module** allows you to easily capture email addresses from users through customizable forms. You can activate this module in various sections of your site, including the Hero Section, Footer, and Blog. Additionally, it offers the functionality to export collected email addresses in Excel format, making it simple to manage and use the data for your email marketing campaigns.

###### 🧩 Module Organization 

Drag and drop modules when creating a page.

Warriorfolio also offers the option to attach and detach modules globally. This makes it easier when you want the layout to repeat across all your pages, avoiding repetition during creation. By default, when you choose fixed attachment, Warriorfolio will follow the following order:

| Order | Module                   | Attached by Default |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1     | Header                   | ✅ Yes               |
| 2     | Hero Section             | ❌ No                |
| 3     | Projects                 | ❌ No                |
| 4     | Courses                  | ❌ No                |
| 5     | Customers                | ❌ No                |
| 6     | Subscribers / Newsletter | ❌ No                |
| 7     | Footer                   | ✅ Yes               |


In Warriorfolio, **all modules are activated and ready to use**. This means that each module is available for you to add and customize as you build your site. However, not all modules are activated in a way that they will **repeat across pages automatically** when you create new ones.

This is where the **attachment option** comes into play. By default, modules like **Header** and **Footer** are attached across all pages, ensuring consistency and preventing the need for manual repetition each time you create a new page. However, modules like the **Hero Section**, **Projects**, and **Customers** are not attached by default, meaning you have the flexibility to decide where and how these modules will appear on your pages.

You can manage this easily via the Dashboard under `App Settings`, where you can enable or disable the global attachment of these modules. This approach helps you maintain a clean, flexible layout structure while avoiding unnecessary repetition when building your pages.
