##### 📘 Quick: Wiki, Tips & FAQ

Here you will find some quick tips and frequently asked questions about Warriorfolio 2.

🛑 **Avoid creating multiple users. Warriorfolio 2 is not designed for multi-user environments.**  
Warriorfolio 2 is built to be simple and fast, and is not intended for use in multi-user scenarios. If you require multi-user functionality, we recommend using WordPress. There are no current plans to support multi-users. In some cases, files or information may be generated based on the first or last default user, which could result in issues such as breaking the app or requiring a reset.

⚠️ **Do not change the names of folders or files.**  
Unless you're absolutely sure of what you're doing, avoid changing the names of folders or files. Warriorfolio 2 follows Laravel's standard structure and is a closed system. Changing file names could cause issues and break the functionality.

❓ **Why is there a limit of 12 projects in Warriorfolio 2?**  
As Warriorfolio 2 is designed to be a landing page, we believe that a display limit of 12 projects is sufficient for fast and dynamic loading. However, you can register as many projects as you like and even adjust this display limit as needed.

No. Warriorfolio 2 is an Open Source application licensed under the MIT license. You can freely use, modify, and even sell your app. Just remember to give credit to the creators of Laravel, Filament, Livewire, and of course, to me! 💜
