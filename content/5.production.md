##### üöÄ On Production  

Deploying this project to production follows all Laravel recommendations. However, since this app is built with Filament, a few extra steps are required.  

###### üõë Error 403 ‚Äì Access Denied  

If you encounter a **403 Forbidden** error when trying to access the admin panel in production, follow these steps to resolve it:  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> - Ensure you have a **strong password** for your application.  
> - This error typically occurs if you haven't configured your **User Model** to grant access to Filament in a non-local environment.  

###### ‚úÖ Solution: Implement the `FilamentUser` Contract  

To allow access to Filament, you must update your `User` model to implement the `FilamentUser` contract:  

```php
<?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
 
class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser
{
    // ...
 
    public function canAccessPanel(Panel $panel): bool
    {
        return str_ends_with($this->email, '@yourdomain.com') && $this->hasVerifiedEmail();
    }
}

```

You can find this information in the [Filament Documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/users#authorizing-access-to-the-panel).


##### üéØ Faker on Production  

By default, **Faker** is a dependency used only in development environments to generate fake data for testing. However, **Warriorfolio** relies on **Seeders** to populate certain data, which may require **Faker** even in production.  

If your app throws an error related to **Faker** during seeding or installation in production, follow these steps:  

###### ‚úÖ How to Install Faker in Production  
Run the following command:  

```bash
composer require fakerphp/faker --dev
```

###### üîë Why is This Necessary?

Although **Faker** is typically a development-only dependency, **Warriorfolio** uses it in some **Seeders** to generate sample content. If you're running seeders on your production server, installing **Faker** ensures the app works correctly.

If you don't need to generate sample content in production, you can **comment out** any seeders that use **Faker** before running the seeding command.

::alert{type="info"}
‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip:** Always review your Seeders before running them in production to avoid unnecessary data insertion.

###### ‚òÅÔ∏è on Laravel Cloud

You can easily deploy **Warriorfolio** on **[Laravel Cloud](https://laravel.cloud)** ‚Äî the official cloud platform for deploying and managing Laravel applications.

With **Laravel Cloud**, you can deploy your app with just a few commands, without worrying about server configurations. The platform automatically manages infrastructure, security, and scalability for your application.

üî• All you need to do is push your project to **GitHub** or **GitLab**, connect your repository to Laravel Cloud, and it will handle the rest ‚Äî including domain setup, SSL certificates, and automated deployments.
