# On Production
To deploy this project to Production, we follow all the Laravel recommendations, and a few more steps need to be added, as this app is developed with Filament.

### Error 403
To avoid the 403 error when accessing the admin in production, follow these steps:

>⚠️
>Create a strong password for your app.
>When deploying your Filament administration panel in a non-local environment and receiving 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access it, you may have forgotten to configure your user model to access Filament.

**You must implement the FilamentUser contract:**
```php
<?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
 
class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser
{
    // ...
 
    public function canAccessPanel(Panel $panel): bool
    {
        return str_ends_with($this->email, '@yourdomain.com') && $this->hasVerifiedEmail();
    }
}

```

The `canAccessPanel()` method returns true or false depending on whether the user is allowed to access the `$panel`. In this example, we check if the user's email ends with `@yourdomain.com` and if they have verified their email address.
