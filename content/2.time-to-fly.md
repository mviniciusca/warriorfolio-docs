###### Launching Your Application 💻

In the development environment, since it's a Laravel application, follow the common processes for initializing an application. If you haven't seen the [Getting Started](getting-started) section, you can also check the official [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).

Access your application at `http://localhost:8000`

💡 In production, you may need to install the Faker class via composer, as it is only available in development in your `composer.json`.

###### Control Panel Access 🔐

To enter the control panel, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin`. Use these initial credentials:

::alert{type="info"}
**Username:** `warriorfolio@test.dev`  
**Password:** `password`

⚠️ **Security Tip**: Immediately change these credentials, especially in production environments.

###### Post-Build: Exploring Warriorfolio 2 🔍

Now that your application is running, let's dive into customization and advanced features.

###### Customizing Theme Colors 🎨

Warriorfolio 2 uses Tailwind CSS via Vite. Modify theme colors in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
theme: {
    extend: {
        colors: {
            primary: colors.purple,
            secondary: colors.zinc,
            tertiary: colors.rose,
        }
    },
},
```

Default color scheme:
- `primary`: Purple
- `secondary`: Zinc
- `tertiary`: Rose
