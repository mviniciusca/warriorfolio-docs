##### ⚡ Features

In its new version, Warriorfolio arrives with numerous features that will help assemble a rich content portfolio.

Its structure is composed of modules, whether they are from the Core (which cannot be altered) or Content Blocks, which are small pieces of code that form ready-to-use elements on your website.

Think of it as a large Lego set, where you simply insert what you want. Whether in the production of pages or the elements that will be inserted into them. You assemble it your way.

###### ⚙️ Maintenance Mode and Discovery Mode

While in this mode, Warriorfolio still accepts **email submissions** and displays **social media links**, keeping essential interactions active.  

To preview your website during maintenance, enable **Discovery Mode** — making the website visible only to you under the current logged-in session.
