##### ⚡ Features

In its new version, Warriorfolio arrives with numerous features that will help assemble a rich content portfolio.

Its structure is composed of modules, whether they are from the Core (which cannot be altered) or Content Blocks, which are small pieces of code that form ready-to-use elements on your website.

Think of it as a large Lego set, where you simply insert what you want. Whether in the production of pages or the elements that will be inserted into them. You assemble it your way.

###### 🖱️ **Drag-drop Page Builder**
The **Drag-drop Page Builder** is an intuitive, user-friendly tool that allows you to create web pages by simply dragging and dropping elements into place. This tool removes the need for coding, providing a visually interactive and fast way to build complex page layouts. It offers flexibility by enabling users to customize the structure and design of their pages with ease.

The builder provides access to a range of **core modules** and **components**, which can be combined to create dynamic and engaging elements. For instance, you can combine text, images, and buttons to form a cohesive call-to-action section, or integrate various design components like dividers, sliders, and testimonials to enhance the overall layout.

With the built-in gradient feature, the Beam automatically adapts to both light and dark themes. In a Light Theme, it can feature soft, airy gradients that smoothly transition between light hues, creating a fresh and clean look. In a Dark Theme, the gradient shifts to deeper tones, ensuring the separator stands out without compromising the overall dark aesthetic.

You can also create custom elements by combining different modules, such as mixing a **Feature Icon List** with a **Heading Description** or using a **Slider** alongside a **Testimonial** to showcase a collection of client feedback. This combination capability helps you build complex designs without any hassle, allowing for maximum creativity while ensuring all elements work seamlessly together.

With the **Drag-drop Page Builder**, building a page is as simple as selecting the elements you need and placing them where you want them. This functionality not only saves time but also allows users with no coding experience to create professional-looking websites. It’s a perfect tool for designers, developers, or anyone who wants full control over the page layout, offering endless possibilities for customization.
