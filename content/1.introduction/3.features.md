# Features

In its new version, Warriorfolio arrives with numerous features that will help assemble a rich content portfolio.

Its structure is composed of modules, whether they are from the Core (which cannot be altered) or Content Blocks, which are small pieces of code that form ready-to-use elements on your website.

Think of it as a large Lego set, where you simply insert what you want. Whether in the production of pages or the elements that will be inserted into them. You assemble it your way.

### Core Modules
Core modules are pre-structured and ready-to-use components. They consist of:

- Header
- Hero Section
- About Section
- Portfolio Section
- Customers Section
- Contact Section
- Newsletter  
- Footer

### Components
Components are small independent modules used for building your page layout. They can be combined with other elements, forming a single scheme.

These components are divided into Design and Component, and currently include the following modules:

- Beam: Design Element, which adds a page divider in the form of a beam of light.
- Button Group: Adds a group of up to two buttons on the page.
- CTA Image + Text: Adds a CTA with an image on the left and text on the right.
- Feature Icon List: Creates a group consisting of text, an icon, and can be centered or not. Great for feature descriptions.
- Heading Description: Adds a title with a description. Use this to start the header of a page.
- Slider: Adds a slider to your page with up to 5 elements per view.
- Testimonial: Add a testimonial from a client, user, or specific person to your page.
- Empty Separator: Adds empty space between sections or components of your page.
- InfoBumper: Adds a small information element consisting of a tag, title, and an icon. This is ideal for highlighting any news or general updates on your page.

### Maintenance Mode and Discovery Mode
By activating Maintenance Mode, your website becomes disabled for viewing. However, you can still receive emails and display your social networks. If you want to view it, simply activate Discovery Mode, and the website will be visible to you under the logged-in session.
