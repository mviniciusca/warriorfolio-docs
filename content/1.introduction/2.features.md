# Features

As you already know, Warriorfolio is a Laravel based project. The project structure is almost the same as any other Laravel project. Warriorfolio uses Filament as main core, so you will see some differences in the structure of the project.
## Directory Structure

This is the minimal directory structure to get an up and running Docus website.

```bash
content/
  index.md
app.config.ts
nuxt.config.ts
```

The `content/` directory is where you [write Markdown pages](/introduction/writing-pages).

The `app.config.ts` is where you [configure Docus](/introduction/configuration) to fit your branding and design.


The `nuxt.config.ts` is your [Nuxt configuration](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/configuration).
